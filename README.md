## The Agentic Vision

Transforming static dashboards into autonomous, conversational systems that reason, plan, and act.

Through agentic architecture, my projects explore multi-agent orchestration for logistics operations, real-time reasoning loops for dynamic ETA and berth optimization, and data-driven decision pipelines combining AI, APIs, and domain logic.

Each AI Lab prototype represents a step toward intelligent freight ecosystems—blending LLM reasoning, port operations logic, and data visualization for truly adaptive workflows.

## Professional Recommendation

*"Pratik worked for me for 18 months while I managed two key products within Solera's Vehicle Solutions division. He consistently exceeded expectations—managing engineering squads effectively and taking ownership of a critical product module. His data-driven approach, analytical rigor, and stakeholder communication ensured we delivered maximum value across India and the US. Pratik's ability to manage multiple priorities, lead teams, and drive strategic product improvement is truly impressive."*
