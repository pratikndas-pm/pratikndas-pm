## ⚙️ The Agentic Vision  
> Transforming static dashboards into **autonomous, conversational systems** that reason, plan, and act.  

Through **agentic architecture**, my projects explore:  
- Multi-agent orchestration for logistics operations  
- Real-time reasoning loops for dynamic ETA, berth, and rate optimization  
- Data-driven decision pipelines combining AI, APIs, and domain logic  

Each AI Lab prototype represents a **step toward intelligent freight ecosystems** — blending **LLM reasoning**, **port operations logic**, and **data visualization** for truly adaptive workflows.

## 📈 Product Impact Highlights  
- 📊 **+18 % improvement** in simulated quote-to-booking conversion via pricing intelligence  
- ⏱ **60 % reduction** in manual freight rate discovery through conversational AI  
- ⚙️ **Predictive ETAs & crane planning models** for maritime and intermodal operations  
- 💡 **Rapid AI MVPs (< 8 weeks)** delivering real business proof points
